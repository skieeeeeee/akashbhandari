### 🚀 About Me

I'm not just writing code — I'm on a quest to turn caffeine into scalable software.

- 🌱 Currently diving into **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, and **Machine Learning**
- 🛠️ Always hands-on with mini-projects, hackathon builds, and late-night “what-if” ideas
- 💡 Open to collaborations — especially if you're cooking up something innovative (or borderline chaotic, I don't judge)
- 🔍 Interests: **AI Agents**, **productivity tools**, and anything that automates life better than I do
- 🌐 Currently experimenting with: GitHub, Firebase, Express, React, and futuristic tech trends I barely understand but want to
